# Production-Ready APIs sample

A sample code for a presentation "Building production-ready APIs with ASP.NET 2.2".

This repository contains the sample implementation that's using ASP.NET Core 2.2 Preview 2 and requires Visual Studio 2017 15.8.4 or later or .NET Core SDK 2.2.100 Preview 2 to build. 

For an older version of the sample that's using ASP.NET Core 2.1 and for older presentations visit [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/miroslavpopovic/production-ready-apis-sample-2.1).

To follow up the presentation, switch through the various numbered git branches.
